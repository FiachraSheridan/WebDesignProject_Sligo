            The four main forms of longboarding are: Cruising, Freeriding, Freestyling and Downhill. This page will detail the different types of boards suitable for each type of riding.
                <h3>Cruising</h3>
                <p>
                    Cruising is the most common form of riding, as well as the easiest. It usually includes trying to make your ride as smooth as possible, not going too fast, and making wide and easy turns. The boards that are used for this often have a great deal of flex to them, and the size of the board can vary greatly. the two main types of boards used for this are Pintails and cruisers.

                    <li>Pintails</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pintails are boards that usually are in a long exaggerated oval shape, similar to a thin water droplet. They usually have a great deal of flex to them, which helps provide an extremely smooth ride, that helps the rider not feel any bumps or cracks the board may roll over.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cruisers</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>
                        Cruisers are longboards with a tail that is curved upwards, similar to a skateboards tail. This tail allows the board to be able to manouver around easily, allowing effortless movement on the board.
                    </p>
                
                <h3>Freeriding</h3>
                <p>
                    Freeriding is one of the more extreme forms of riding, and quite difficult to achieve for a beginner rider. Freerifing includes travelling at relatively high speeds in order to do a trick called a "power slide". A power slide is achieved by turning the longboard sharply at high speeds, making the board start sliding forwards on its side. The types of boards needed for this need to be very stable. The main type of board used for this is ironically, called a freeride board. Freeride boards are usually quite long, and stiff, providing more responsive movements at high speeds. They are usually made out of maple, for its stiff makeup and durability.

                <h3>Freestyle</h3>
                <p>
                    Freestyle is a form of street skating, and one of the most popular forms besides cruising. It includes using small longboards to dodge traffic in busy cities, and learning to use natural obsticles to perform tricks on the board. The main tyle of board used here is a mini cruiser. This is a board that looks very similar to a cruiser, but is much smaller. mini cruisers are usually only around the size of an average skateboard. Unlike the larger cruiser, the mini cruisers small size makes it perfect for the busy streets of a city.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Downhill</h3>
                <p>
                    Downhill is by far the most dangerous and extreme of the different riding styles. It includes going down massive hills at really high speeds, with no way of breaking except for power slides. There is only one type of board that can be safely used for this, and that is the drop down board. A drop down board looks similar to a freeride board, but has most if the board dropped close to the ground to provide stability and a good platform to power slide on. People who practice downhill riding with drop down boards have gone at speeds upwards of 80 km/h.
